# Next.js 15 Client-Side Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when upgrading to Next.js 15, specifically related to client-side navigation using the `next/link` component.  The issue stems from changes in how Next.js 15 handles routing and client-side transitions.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file contains a simple component that uses the `next/link` component for navigation.  However, under certain conditions in Next.js 15, this component may fail to navigate correctly or throw errors, often due to issues with asynchronous rendering or incorrect usage of the `Link` component.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the component, addressing the identified navigation error.  The solution may involve updating the `next/link` usage, handling potential errors using error boundaries, or ensuring correct asynchronous data fetching within the component.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the affected page and reproduce the error.
5. Compare the original and corrected code to understand the fix.
